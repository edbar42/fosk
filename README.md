# FOSK
FOSK (_Free and Open Source Knowledge_) is a collection of tech-related books and webpages that are free to read. 

I much prefer to study using books. Even though I enjoy taking classes (including video lectures) to get introduced to a new subject, I find that deeper knowledge is always restricted to books or blog posts, hence why I'm refraining from adding video courses to this list. 

Also, if you're just starting out learning a subject, it's far easier to find a good video - or series of videos - than it is to find a good book.

### **This project was born out of my necessity to find good study material for my self-taught journey. Hoprfully, this helps you on yours as well.**
